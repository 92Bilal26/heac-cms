**HEAC Website Content Plan**

**Main Navigation:** Home \| About Us \| Services ▼ \| Training & Events
\| Resources & Publications \| Team & Scholars \| Contact Us. These tabs
cover the full scope of HEAC's offerings, echoing industry examples.

**Hero/Home Page:**

A large **hero image** of a modern Islamic financial center or bank
façade (as in \[22\]) should headline the page, with an overlaid tagline
such as *"Your Trusted Partner in Islamic Finance
Solutions"*[[alhilalsa.com]{.underline}](https://alhilalsa.com/#:~:text=Your%20trusted%20partner%20in%20Islamic,finance%20solutions).
Below the image, a concise **intro paragraph** explains HEAC's mission
to advance the halal economy globally (mirroring Al Hilal's "legacy of
excellence"
message[[alhilalsa.com]{.underline}](https://alhilalsa.com/#:~:text=With%20a%20legacy%20of%20excellence,the%20future%20of%20Islamic%20finance)).
A prominent **call-to-action** button ("Book a Consultation" or "Contact
Us") is placed here (similar to "Submit your inquiry now" on
Almaarij[[almaarijc.com]{.underline}](https://almaarijc.com/services#:~:text=info%40almaaijc)).

-   **Why Choose HEAC:** A section of 3--4 bullet points or icons
    highlights key advantages: e.g. "Global Shariah expertise (team of
    recognized scholars)", "Comprehensive services across Islamic
    finance", "Licensed and
    industry-certified"[[asasadvisory.com](https://asasadvisory.com/#:~:text=ASAS%20Shariah%20Advisory%20,Shariah%20Scholars%20and%20support%20team)[usmaniandco.com](https://usmaniandco.com/#:~:text=Usmani%20%26%20Co,and%20globally%20present%20strategic%20partners)]{.underline},
    "Multilingual advisors with worldwide reach." This builds trust by
    echoing competitors' language (e.g. *"multi-disciplinary,
    multi-linguistic"*[[usmaniandco.com]{.underline}](https://usmaniandco.com/#:~:text=Usmani%20%26%20Co,and%20globally%20present%20strategic%20partners)).

-   **Featured Services:** A snapshot of core services on the Home page
    (with small icons) -- for example: "Shariah Advisory", "Audit &
    Compliance", "Sukuk Structuring", "Halal Certification", "Training &
    Education" -- each linking to the detailed Services page. These
    should use inspiring headings and short descriptions (e.g. "Tailored
    Shariah Compliance Solutions", "Expert Audits to Ensure Faith-Based
    Integrity" as seen on competitor
    sites[[almaarijc.com](https://almaarijc.com/services#:~:text=Shariah%20Compliance%20Services)[azkaadvisors.com](https://azkaadvisors.com/shariah-advisory-product-structuring/#:~:text=Tailored%20Product%20Structuring)]{.underline}).

-   **Testimonials/Clients:** A slider or section with **client
    testimonials** and logos. (E.g. *"Working with HEAC's scholars gave
    us confidence that our new Sukuk met all requirements."* -- Client
    CEO.) This mimics Usmani & Co.'s "We are very glad to get client
    review"
    section[[usmaniandco.com]{.underline}](https://usmaniandco.com/#:~:text=We%20are%20very%20glad%20to,get%20client%20review).
    Below the quotes, logos of major corporate or financial clients
    (drawn from Al Hilal's extensive client
    gallery[[alhilalsa.com]{.underline}](https://alhilalsa.com/#:~:text=Our%20Clients))
    provide social proof.

-   **News/Updates:** Optionally include latest blog posts or news
    headlines at page bottom to show thought leadership, as Usmani & Co.
    and Al Hilal do.

-   **Footer CTA:** Repeat a "Contact Us for a Consultation"
    call-to-action (like the Almaarij footer
    prompt[[almaarijc.com]{.underline}](https://almaarijc.com/services#:~:text=info%40almaaijc)),
    plus basic contact info.

**About Us**

-   **Overview:** A brief narrative about HEAC's founding, vision and
    mission. For example: *"HEAC was established to promote a
    Shariah-compliant global economy by providing innovative ethical
    financial solutions"* (modeled on Usmani's
    mission[[usmaniandco.com]{.underline}](https://usmaniandco.com/#:~:text=Usmani%20%26%20Co,compliant%20innovative%20and%20customized%20solutions)
    and ASAS's
    mission[[asasadvisory.com]{.underline}](https://asasadvisory.com/#:~:text=To%20facilitate%20the%20society%20by,the%20delivery%20of%20Shariah%20compliant)).

-   **Vision & Mission:** Two subsections: **Mission:** e.g. "Encourage
    ethical principles in Islamic economic activity through tailored
    Shariah-compliant solutions." **Vision:** e.g. "Establish a robust
    halal economy free from riba-based constraints," citing inspiration
    from Usmani's
    vision[[usmaniandco.com]{.underline}](https://usmaniandco.com/#:~:text=Usmani%20%26%20Co,compliant%20innovative%20and%20customized%20solutions).
    Use bullet points or short paragraphs.

-   **Credentials:** Mention **professional certifications and
    licenses**. For example: "Registered with SECP (Pakistan) and
    affiliated with \[relevant bodies\], HEAC adheres to the highest
    compliance standards." This is a trust signal seen in ASAS's copy
    (e.g. "registered with
    SECP"[[asasadvisory.com]{.underline}](https://asasadvisory.com/#:~:text=ASAS%20Shariah%20Advisory%20,Shariah%20Scholars%20and%20support%20team)).
    Also note global presence: "offices/partners in major Islamic
    finance centers."

-   **Our Approach:** A short section (with an icon or image) describing
    HEAC's approach: e.g. "Cross-disciplinary team of scholars and
    finance experts" -- echo ASAS's *"devoted, specialized, proficient
    and prominent Shariah
    scholars"*[[asasadvisory.com]{.underline}](https://asasadvisory.com/#:~:text=ASAS%20Shariah%20Advisory%20,Shariah%20Scholars%20and%20support%20team)
    -- and "Customized solutions for each client."

-   **Team Teaser:** Include photos or graphics of 2--4 lead scholars
    (to be expanded on the Team page).

-   **Call to Action:** End with a prompt like "Learn more about our
    team and values" or link to the Contact page.

**Services**

A **Services** page (or section) lists all major offerings with
structured headings and descriptions. Each service title is styled as a
header (e.g. H3/H4), followed by a short explanatory paragraph. Key
services include:

-   **Shariah Advisory & Consultancy:** HEAC provides *"comprehensive
    Islamic finance advisory services"* tailored to clients'
    needs[[almaarijc.com]{.underline}](https://almaarijc.com/services#:~:text=).
    Subservices can be bulleted or in subheaders: e.g. Shariah-compliant
    product design, regulatory reform advice, treasury & corporate
    structuring, etc. (similar to Usmani's listing of Sukuk structuring,
    product development and service
    management[[usmaniandco.com](https://usmaniandco.com/#:~:text=Sukuk%20Structuring)[usmaniandco.com](https://usmaniandco.com/#:~:text=Shariah%20Advisory%20Services%20for%20Regulatory,Reforms)]{.underline}).

-   **Shariah Audit & Compliance:** Regular internal/external Shariah
    audits for banks, Takaful and investment firms, ensuring all
    transactions and reports adhere to Shariah law. (As ASAS notes,
    "effective risk-based internal and external Shariah audit and
    compliance
    services"[[asasadvisory.com]{.underline}](https://asasadvisory.com/#:~:text=Shariah%20Audit).)
    Emphasize rigorous process and reporting.

-   **Shariah Certification & Fatwa Issuance:** HEAC issues formal
    Shariah opinions and certificates for products, as well as fatwas on
    new matters. (Azka's process highlights: *"We deliver a formal
    Shariah opinion or
    certificate..."*[[azkaadvisors.com]{.underline}](https://azkaadvisors.com/shariah-advisory-product-structuring/#:~:text=04).)
    For example, "Halal Business Certification" for non-financial
    products (food, cosmetics, etc.) and "Shariah Certification" for
    finance products. A description like Al Hilal's *"We certify
    products to meet Islamic dietary
    standards"*[[alhilalsa.com]{.underline}](https://alhilalsa.com/#:~:text=Halal%20Food%20Certification)
    can guide phrasing.

-   **Islamic Finance Structuring:** Expert design of complex financial
    instruments -- **Sukuk structuring**, Islamic funds, Islamic
    insurance (Takaful) models, microfinance schemes, etc. Emulate
    Azka's language: *"Custom Shariah structures for banking, fintech,
    crypto, or halal
    businesses"*[[azkaadvisors.com]{.underline}](https://azkaadvisors.com/shariah-advisory-product-structuring/#:~:text=Tailored%20Product%20Structuring).
    Mention innovative areas like fintech, blockchain and crypto
    compliance (Azka's specialty) to show forward-thinking services.

-   **Investment Screening & Portfolio Advisory:** Screening of
    equity/debt investments for Shariah compliance (as Al Hilal's
    "Equity Investment Screening"
    service[[alhilalsa.com]{.underline}](https://alhilalsa.com/#:~:text=Equity%20Investment%20Screening)).
    Portfolio selection guidance (drawing on Usmani's mutual funds
    distribution
    concept[[usmaniandco.com]{.underline}](https://usmaniandco.com/#:~:text=Takaful%20%26%20Re)).
    Include screening for all asset classes.

-   **Zakat and Charity Advisory:** Guidance on Zakat calculation and
    management for individuals, companies and NGOs (inspired by Al
    Hilal's "Zakat Advisory"
    offering[[alhilalsa.com]{.underline}](https://alhilalsa.com/#:~:text=Zakat%20Advisory)).
    Briefly mention Waqf and zakat planning services.

-   **Halal Business Advisory:** Consultancy for non-financial halal
    sectors -- e.g. food, travel, cosmetics. (Azka mentions halal food,
    halal cosmetics, halal
    travel[[azkaadvisors.com]{.underline}](https://azkaadvisors.com/shariah-advisory-product-structuring/#:~:text=Structuring%20for%20both%20financial%20and,businesses%2C%20halal%20travel%2C%20and%20more).)
    Include *"Halal Certification"* service for products and "Ethical &
    Governance Consulting" for halal organizations.

-   **Shariah Training & Education:** HEAC designs **custom training
    programs and workshops**. Offerings include in-house corporate
    training (e.g. "Islamic Finance 101", Shariah audit training),
    public seminars (like ASAS's "Seminar & Workshop" page), and online
    courses. ASAS emphasizes "Shariah Trainings...designed by highly
    qualified
    professionals"[[asasadvisory.com]{.underline}](https://asasadvisory.com/#:~:text=Shariah%20Trainings),
    and Azka lists "Executive Workshops, Online Courses, In-House
    Training"[[azkaadvisors.com]{.underline}](https://azkaadvisors.com/shariah-advisory-product-structuring/#:~:text=Training%20%26%20Development).
    List a few sample courses (e.g. *"Certified Shariah Auditor
    Course"*, *"Fintech & Shariah"*).

Each service section ends with its own **Call to Action**, e.g. "Contact
us to arrange this service" or "Get a free assessment". For example,
Azka's style "Book a consultation with Azka
Advisors..."[[azkaadvisors.com]{.underline}](https://azkaadvisors.com/shariah-advisory-product-structuring/#:~:text=Ready%20to%20align%20your%20vision,and%20let%E2%80%99s%20shape%20something%20remarkable%E2%80%94together)
can inspire a HEAC CTA like **"Schedule Your Free Shariah Audit
Consultation"**.

**Team & Scholars**

This page profiles HEAC's leadership and advisory board.

-   **Our Experts:** Photos and short bios of key figures: CEO, Chief
    Shariah Advisor, Board of Shariah Scholars, senior analysts.
    Emphasize credentials (e.g. advanced Islamic law qualifications,
    industry experience). For example, "Dr. X, **President & CEO**,"
    with bullet points of his background (similar to Usmani's team
    layout[[usmaniandco.com](https://usmaniandco.com/#:~:text=Our%20expert%20team%20will%20help,you)[usmaniandco.com](https://usmaniandco.com/#:~:text=,USMANI)]{.underline}).

-   **Advisory Board:** List distinguished scholars on the board (names
    and titles), reinforcing trust.

-   **Methodology:** A sidebar or graphic could outline HEAC's advisory
    process (inspired by Azka's 4-step
    process[[azkaadvisors.com]{.underline}](https://azkaadvisors.com/shariah-advisory-product-structuring/#:~:text=How%20We%20Work)),
    to show professionalism and transparency: 1) Discovery, 2) Research
    & Structuring, 3) Review & Feedback, 4) Certification.

-   **CTA:** Encourage readers to contact a specific expert or request a
    meeting.

**Training & Events**

Either part of Services or its own page. List upcoming **workshops,
seminars, and courses**. Each item has date, location (or "online"), and
a short description. Include an example course (e.g. *"Islamic Banking
Fundamentals"*, *"Advanced Shariah Audit"*). Allow users to **register
or inquire**. This mirrors ASAS's "Seminar & Workshop" section.

**Resources & Publications**

-   **Blog/Insights:** A blog feed with posts on industry trends (e.g.
    *"Role of Sukuk in Sustainable Finance"*, echoing Usmani's latest
    blog
    section[[usmaniandco.com]{.underline}](https://usmaniandco.com/#:~:text=Blog)).

-   **Fatwa Archive:** A searchable library of HEAC's published fatwas
    or case opinions (like Al Hilal's "Fatwaas" page). Each entry has a
    title, brief excerpt, and PDF/download link.

-   **Publications:** Whitepapers and research reports (e.g. *"Guide to
    Shariah-Compliant Crypto"*, *"Islamic Finance Yearbook"*). Include
    cover images and download links.

-   **FAQs:** A short FAQ answering common questions about Islamic
    finance and HEAC's services.

-   **Newsletter Signup:** Invitation to subscribe for updates.

Each resource entry should have a headline and 2--3 line summary. Use
category headers (e.g. "Blogs", "Fatwas", "Publications") just like Al
Hilal's Resources
menu[[alhilalsa.com]{.underline}](https://alhilalsa.com/#:~:text=,12).

**Contact Us**

-   **Contact Form:** Name, email, organization, message fields with a
    *"Submit Inquiry"* button (as on
    Almaarij[[almaarijc.com]{.underline}](https://almaarijc.com/services#:~:text=Contact%20us%20for%20consultation%20services)).
    This should be prominent.

-   **Office Information:** Address(es) (e.g. "Karachi, London, Kuala
    Lumpur"), phone, and email (using contact shown in
    references[[almaarijc.com]{.underline}](https://almaarijc.com/services#:~:text=info%40almaaijc)).

-   **Map/Travel Info:** Embedded map for main office.

-   **Social Links:** Icons linking to LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.

-   **Call to Action:** Reinforce the invitation: e.g. "Let us help you
    succeed in the halal economy -- reach out today."

**Calls to Action, Testimonials & Trust Signals**

-   **CTAs (calls to action):** Strategically placed buttons and prompts
    throughout the site, such as *"Contact Us for Consultation"*,
    *"Request a Shariah Audit"*, *"Enroll in a Training"*. For example,
    Almaarij ends sections with "Submit your inquiry
    now"[[almaarijc.com]{.underline}](https://almaarijc.com/services#:~:text=Contact%20us%20for%20consultation%20services);
    Azka uses "Book a
    consultation"[[azkaadvisors.com]{.underline}](https://azkaadvisors.com/shariah-advisory-product-structuring/#:~:text=Ready%20to%20align%20your%20vision,and%20let%E2%80%99s%20shape%20something%20remarkable%E2%80%94together).
    Each page should invite engagement.

-   **Testimonials:** Feature brief client endorsements on the Home or
    Services pages (e.g. *"HEAC helped us structure our first Sukuk --
    guidance was exceptional" -- CFO, ABC Bank*). These lend
    credibility, as seen on Usmani's
    site[[usmaniandco.com]{.underline}](https://usmaniandco.com/#:~:text=We%20are%20very%20glad%20to,get%20client%20review).
    Real logos and names (or anonymized quotes if needed) are ideal.

-   **Trust Signals:** Prominently display associations and
    certifications. For example, a "Licensed by \[Regulator\]" badge,
    AAOIFI membership, or ISRA/AAOIFI alum affiliation (if applicable).
    Showcase **client logos** in a carousel (as Al Hilal does with
    dozens of corporate
    logos[[alhilalsa.com]{.underline}](https://alhilalsa.com/#:~:text=Our%20Clients)).
    Mention key statistics or awards ("100+ clients served globally,"
    "10 years of experience," etc.) to further reinforce credibility.

-   **Footer:** In the site footer, repeat critical trust badges (e.g.
    partner organizations), contact info, and a mini-menu.

**Inspiration from References:** This plan draws on the structure and
wording of the example sites. For instance, it includes diverse services
such as Shariah advisory, audit & compliance, Sukuk/product structuring,
and halal
certification[[almaarijc.com](https://almaarijc.com/services#:~:text=Shariah%20Compliance%20Services)[usmaniandco.com](https://usmaniandco.com/#:~:text=Takaful%20%26%20Re)]{.underline};
emphasizes training and thought
leadership[[asasadvisory.com](https://asasadvisory.com/#:~:text=Shariah%20Trainings)[azkaadvisors.com](https://azkaadvisors.com/shariah-advisory-product-structuring/#:~:text=Training%20%26%20Development)]{.underline};
and uses clear CTAs and client endorsements as seen on Usmani & Co. and
Azka[[almaarijc.com](https://almaarijc.com/services#:~:text=Contact%20us%20for%20consultation%20services)[azkaadvisors.com](https://azkaadvisors.com/shariah-advisory-product-structuring/#:~:text=Ready%20to%20align%20your%20vision,and%20let%E2%80%99s%20shape%20something%20remarkable%E2%80%94together)]{.underline}.
By combining these elements, HEAC's website will present a
comprehensive, trustworthy portal for global Islamic finance clients.

**Sources:** Service and page ideas are modeled on the reviewed sites.
For example, HEAC's *"Shariah Compliance Services"* concept is drawn
from Almaarij's
description[[almaarijc.com]{.underline}](https://almaarijc.com/services#:~:text=Shariah%20Compliance%20Services),
and the list of service categories (Takaful, Sukuk, Audit, Halal
certification, etc.) is based on Usmani & Co.'s
offerings[[usmaniandco.com]{.underline}](https://usmaniandco.com/#:~:text=Takaful%20%26%20Re).
The training and resources sections take cues from ASAS and
Azka[[asasadvisory.com](https://asasadvisory.com/#:~:text=Shariah%20Trainings)[azkaadvisors.com](https://azkaadvisors.com/shariah-advisory-product-structuring/#:~:text=Training%20%26%20Development)]{.underline}.
Contact prompts and testimonials follow patterns shown in the
references[[almaarijc.com](https://almaarijc.com/services#:~:text=info%40almaaijc)[usmaniandco.com](https://usmaniandco.com/#:~:text=We%20are%20very%20glad%20to,get%20client%20review)]{.underline}.
These citations illustrate how each element is grounded in industry
examples.
